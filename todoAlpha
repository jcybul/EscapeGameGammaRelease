Todo for alpha release


CREATE ALL TYPES OF COORDINATES
   1. Square coordinate distance test:

	(1,1)->(2,2) 1  
	(1,2)->(3,5) 3 
	
	
   2. Hexagonal Coordinates:
  	(0,0)->(-1,2)  2 
  	(-1,2)->(2,-2) 4
  	(-1,-1)->(1,1) 4
  	(-1,-1)->(2,0) 4
  	
  
  
   3. Orthogonal Coordinates:
  	(1,1)->(2,2) 2
  	(1,2->(3,5) 5
  	(7,8)->(4,3) 8
   4. throw exception when comparing two different coordinate types
  		Square with orthoSquare -> exception
  		Orthosquare with hex -> exception
  		hex with Square   -> exceptionc
  
 
 
 
CREATE A SQUARE BOARD FROM FILE 

TEST:													    RETURN:
CREATE A SQUARE  BOARD WITH ALL THE APROPIATE VALUES		GOOD
	5.  initialize a board with some pieces from file
	    get piece that was placed at 2,2
     	the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	8.	acces a cordinate outside of the size of the board 
			1.one for less than 1 
			2.one for more than the max
	
	10. place a piece on a exit position check is empty
	
	11. place a piece on a blocked positon -> exception
	
	18. when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	    at given coordinate remove the piece
	
	21.  catch exception when coordinate is out of bounds
	for any of the given fuctions that use it
	
	



CREATE A HEX BOARD FROM FILE
	6.  initilize board with piece from file 
		get piece that was placed at 2,2
		the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	14. getInfo from large coordinates to "prove infinity"
	
	15. place a piece on a exit position and then check that is null 
	
	16. place a piece on a blocked positon
	
	17. place a piece on a undeclared postion from file that should be clear

	20.  when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	at given coordinate remove the piece
	

CREATE AN ORTHO BOARD FROM FIlE
	7.	initilize board with piece from file 
		get piece that was placed at 2,2
		the piece is a horse and placed by player 1
	
	9.	acces a cordinate outside of the size of the board 
			1.one for less than 1 
			2.one for more than the max
	
	12.  place a piece on a exit position and then check that is null 
	
	13.  place a piece on a blocked positon
	
	19.  when a null pieces is passed and a piece was 
	     at given coordinate remove the piece
	
	22.  catch exception when coordinate is out of bounds
	for any of the given fuctions that use it
	

	General test 
	23.  make a board whit an unknown coordinate type                Null
